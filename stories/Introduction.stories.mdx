# BlogSphere Component Library

Welcome to the BlogSphere component library. This Storybook showcases the UI components used throughout our blog application.

## Getting Started

The component library is built using:

- **React** for component architecture
- **TypeScript** for type-safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Shadcn UI** for consistent design patterns

## Component Structure

Components are organized by functionality:

- **UI**: Basic UI elements like buttons, cards, etc.
- **Layout**: Structural components like header, footer, etc.
- **Features**: Complex components tied to specific features

## Usage Guidelines

Each component includes:

- **Interactive demos** to explore different states
- **Documentation** explaining props and usage
- **Code examples** showing implementation

## Developing Components

When creating new components:

1. Start by designing the component in isolation
2. Define clear props and interfaces
3. Create comprehensive stories covering all states
4. Test for accessibility and responsiveness

## Contributing

To add to this component library:

1. Add your component to the appropriate folder in `client/src/components`
2. Create a story file in the `stories` directory
3. Document your component thoroughly
4. Submit a pull request

Happy component building!
